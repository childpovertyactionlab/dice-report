The broken glass theory summarized states that signs of disorder will lead to more disorder. The clean and greens are a mobile, and effective way to combat blight on a community and grassroots level. Each community organization partnered with CPAL for the D.I.C.E. initiative, cleans and remediates their prospective division, and the focus areas within the divisions. These monthly clean and greens allow for the mobilization of residents in the focus areas to also participate in beautifying their communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce Drives\nBetween division site visits and observations coupled with D.I.C.E. event surveying and community feedback one thing became very apparent and stark about each focus area, it was within or around a food desert and food swamp. The surveying we did directly from the community repeatedly mentioned the want for fresh fruits and vegetables and having the ability to afford them. The DICE produce drives allow for real scale across the city to address food issues in the focus areas, as well as safety surrounding the issues of food insecurity as well. Hungry communities harbor unsafe and oftentimes dangerous conditions. Empowering and supporting our community partners who already do this work is essential to the success of this initiative. Without real partnership, scale of this magnitude wouldn’t be possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of D.I.C.E. Work"

Both areas are near the Redbird area of Dallas, a historically Black upper middle class and working class area. Chaucer Pl and Camp Wisdom has six apartment complexes near it within a thousand foot radius. The area also has a good mix of residential housing surrounding it. The areas have three schools within a half mile radius of each other, and the focal point of the community, Redbird Mall, has undergone massive upgrades and investment over the past few years. The investments have made the mall area better, but have no effect on the area outside of the mall like Camp Wisdom and Preferred Place directly across the street. Camp Wisdom and Preferred Place is plagued by open air drug sales, motels/hotels that harbor elements that lead to gun violence in the area, prostitution, illegal gaming rooms and a host of more criminal related activities that keep the area extremely unsafe for the families and residents that reside in it. The City Of Dallas also plans on opening up a houseless shelter, the first of its kind, near the problematic hotels/motels on Preferred Place sometime in 2024.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\n\n\n\n\nPublic Space Improvements\n\n\n\n\n2800 Camp Wisdom Rd, Before\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2800 Camp Wisdom Rd, After\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    “It's nothing for the kids, man. It's sad lowkey. It's a gang of apartments full of children and they get in trouble because there isn't anything to do. No park, no rec center, no court, nothing. We need to change that.”\n    Community Resident\n    \nThe area lacks parks and public spaces for youth to convene. Without safe and fun spaces to spend their time, local youth are more likely to become involved in illegal activity. D.I.C.E plans to transform a vacant lot to meet this need.\n\n\n\n\n\n    “Economic development is all the talk, but I  don't see any of it happening on this side of 67. The young people over here carry guns, shoot at each other, kill each other, rob each other. It's insane. This area needs to be cleansed by jesus. I try my  best to guide the young folks around me as best as I can but there are so many misguided. We need help”\n    Community Resident\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCode Enforcement\n\nRetail strip owners are complacent in the operation of illegal gambling rooms and the sale of unauthorized liquor. Local hotels are often the site of illegal sex work and open air drug sales. The risk of gun violence and crime in the area increases due to the presence of these elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Fresh Food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    “It used to be worse when gangs ran heavy over here. I would like to see more things for families to do come over here. It's good that Red Bird mall is being redone, but that's just the mall. The whole area needs to be redone.”\n    Community Resident\n    \nResidents lack access to fresh, healthy food. The area is a food swamp, saturated with low quality, highly processed options. As the majority of residents rely on public transportation, traveling to obtain fresh food is an unrealistic option. Fresh food must be brought in and distributed locally.\n\n\n\nUrban Blight Abatement\n\n\nCleaning and Greening\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

A high concentration of families and elderly residents reside in the area.

Both areas are entrenched heavily in food swamps. Both areas are also adjacent to major freeways in Dallas, I-30 and 175. In the RL Thornton and Jim Miller area there are three motels within a half mile radius that are utilized as extended stays. This area has a set of apartments near, with residential housing being within a quarter mile radius. Historically, the area has always been working and middle class. The area has recently succumbed to a lot of business and retail neglect. Places that were occupied three to five years ago aren’t any longer. Those places not being occupied have harbored opportunities for gun related crimes to occur. Murdock and Loop 12 sits at the corner of a problematic convenience store and the parking lot of a grocery store. The area has three sets of apartment complexes within a quarter mile radius that’s surrounded by residential housing. There are three schools serving this community within a half mile radius. Home to primarily working class people, this area has been historically neglected and severely affected by systematic divestment.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFence Repair\n\n    \"There's too much foot traffic in and out.

The Esperanza neighborhood is on the border of two cities, Dallas and Richardson. The neighborhood is a mix of housing and apartment complex residential living. There are five schools within a half mile radius and a very high concentration of families in the area. The area historically has been problematic, Esperanza Rd used to be called Maham Rd (pronounced Mayhem) until a name change came in 2017 as part of the revitalization of the area. Statistically it’s one of the higher crime areas in Dallas, but that’s often overlooked and overshaded due to the area around it being primarily business towers, company campuses and at the corner of two major Dallas freeways. The area recently has had major issues with homelessness and houseless encampments, especially in the Cottonwood Creek/Park area. As a result of the neglect, the area has continued to see spikes in violent crimes and especially violent gun crimes over the past few years.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFence Repair\n\n    \"There's too much foot traffic in and out.

Crown Hill Memorial Park and Bolivar and Larga Rd areas are very high density apartment areas. The neighborhood has a very large immigrant population from a plethora of countries. Most of the residents live near or around Dallas Love Field Airport, which in turn subjects the community at large to an inordinate amount of noise pollution. The focus areas of Bolivar and Larga, and Crown Hill Memorial Park struggle with homelessness, which has become a major issue for both residents and business owners in the area. The area has six schools in a quarter mile radius and is currently a food swamp. The violent crime in the area often goes under and unreported due to the immigrant population being afraid of not only the community repercussions, but the legal ones as well. The area has historically always been working and lower middle class but constant neglect, and divestment from that community have made conditions exponentially worse over the past five to six years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFence Repair\n\n    \"There's too much foot traffic in and out.

The area has been historically, and remains somewhat, economically middle on one side (Walnut St) and poor working class on the other (Forest Lane) . The particular focus area of Walnut and Audelia was formerly a bustling Asian based shopping center catering to the demographic that used to live in the neighborhood. The Walnut Mall, a large component of the shopping center, sits empty today. The area consists primarily of apartment complexes extending from Forest Lane to Walnut St. Gangs used to operate heavily in the area and have died off since about 2018, but gun related crimes from robberies to carjackings still remain an issue for both residents and business owners in the area. The neglect that historically existed in the Forest Lane Audelia area seems to have extended into the Walnut and Audelia area. A common theme amongst the Northern divisions of Dallas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFence Repair\n\n    \"There's too much foot traffic in and out.

    "text": "Produce Drives\nBetween division site visits and observations coupled with DICE event surveying and community feedback one thing became very apparent and stark about each focus area, it was within or around a food desert and food swamp. The surveying we did directly from the community repeatedly mentioned the want for fresh fruits and vegetables and having the ability to afford them. The DICE produce drives allow for real scale across the city to address food issues in the focus areas, as well as safety surrounding the issues of food insecurity as well. Hungry communities harbor unsafe and oftentimes dangerous conditions. Empowering and supporting our community partners who already do this work is essential to the success of this initiative. Without real partnership, scale of this magnitude wouldn’t be possible."
