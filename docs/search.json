Both areas are near the Redbird area of Dallas, a historically Black upper middle class and working class area. Chaucer Pl and Camp Wisdom has six apartment complexes near it within a thousand foot radius. The area also has a good mix of residential housing surrounding it. The areas have three schools within a half mile radius of each other, and the focal point of the community, Redbird Mall, has undergone massive upgrades and investment over the past few years. The investments have made the mall area better, but have no effect on the area outside of the mall like Camp Wisdom and Preferred Place directly across the street. Camp Wisdom and Preferred Place is plagued by open air drug sales, motels/hotels that harbor elements that lead to gun violence in the area, prostitution, illegal gaming rooms and a host of more criminal related activities that keep the area extremely unsafe for the families and residents that reside in it. The City Of Dallas also plans on opening up a houseless shelter, the first of its kind, near the problematic hotels/motels on Preferred Place sometime in 2024.\n\n    “The area is changing slowly. I grew up here so I've seen a lot and heard alot. I wish as a kid I had more to get into over here, I didn't realize how  little we had until I got older. The mall being revitalized is cool, I work there so i'm happy about that. But the mall aint gonna help the area get good.

We need to change that.”\n    Community Resident\n    \nThe area lacks parks and public spaces for youth to convene. Without safe and fun spaces to spend their time, local youth are more likely to become involved in illegal activity. D.I.C.E plans to transform a vacant lot to meet this need.\n\n\n\n\n\n    “Economic development is all the talk, but I  don't see any of it happening on this side of 67. The young people over here carry guns, shoot at each other, kill each other, rob each other. It's insane. This area needs to be cleansed by jesus.

We need help”\n    Community Resident\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nCode Enforcement\n\nRetail strip owners are complacent in the operation of illegal gambling rooms and the sale of unauthorized liquor. Local hotels are often the site of illegal sex work and open air drug sales.

The whole area needs to be redone.”\n    Community Resident\n    \nResidents lack access to fresh, healthy food. The area is a food swamp, saturated with low quality, highly processed options. As the majority of residents rely on public transportation, traveling to obtain fresh food is an unrealistic option.

A high concentration of families and elderly residents reside in the area.

The area has been historically, and remains somewhat, economically middle on one side (Walnut St) and poor working class on the other (Forest Lane) . The particular focus area of Walnut and Audelia was formerly a bustling Asian based shopping center catering to the demographic that used to live in the neighborhood. The Walnut Mall, a large component of the shopping center, sits empty today. The area consists primarily of apartment complexes extending from Forest Lane to Walnut St. Gangs used to operate heavily in the area and have died off since about 2018, but gun related crimes from robberies to carjackings still remain an issue for both residents and business owners in the area. The neglect that historically existed in the Forest Lane Audelia area seems to have extended into the Walnut and Audelia area. A common theme amongst the Northern divisions of Dallas.\n\n    “The area has changed immensely over the past few years. It's not as bad as the other end (Forest and Audelia).

    "text": "Data Informed Community Engagement (D.I.C.E), is the City Of Dallas’s Office Of Integrated Public Safety Solutions (OIPSS) mission operationalized. OIPSS strives to enhance the general welfare and safety of Dallas residents by offering non-law enforcement solutions to risks that affect persons, property and the collective well-being of residents. Through an innovative combination of risk terrain modeling (RTM) and community-led risk-narratives, the D.I.C.E process has isolated city locations at the greatest risk of violent crime. These locations make up only 3% of the land area of the City of Dallas, but account for 21% of the total violent gun crimes. Historically neglected and forgotten by the system, these areas lack adequate resources and harbor violent crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity data has yielded a wide array of solutions to support crime prevention efforts. Blight remediation, transformative change, and clean and green beautification efforts are just a few examples of how D.I.C.E plans to heal these communities. Our local partners work vigilantly to apply these solutions in the communities they themselves are already implemented in. This tool is a view of all of the work being done by CPAL’s neighborhood and community partners, as well as OIPPS’s efforts.\n\n\n\n\nCity-Wide Impact of D.I.C.E.

The broken glass theory summarized states that signs of disorder will lead to more disorder. The clean and greens are a mobile, and effective way to combat blight on a community and grassroots level. Each community organization partnered with CPAL for the D.I.C.E. initiative, cleans and remediates their prospective division, and the focus areas within the divisions. These monthly clean and greens allow for the mobilization of residents in the focus areas to also participate in beautifying their communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce Drives\nBetween division site visits and observations coupled with D.I.C.E. event surveying and community feedback one thing became very apparent and stark about each focus area, it was within or around a food desert and food swamp. The surveying we did directly from the community repeatedly mentioned the want for fresh fruits and vegetables and having the ability to afford them. The DICE produce drives allow for real scale across the city to address food issues in the focus areas, as well as safety surrounding the issues of food insecurity as well. Hungry communities harbor unsafe and oftentimes dangerous conditions. Empowering and supporting our community partners who already do this work is essential to the success of this initiative. Without real partnership, scale of this magnitude wouldn’t be possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime data sourced from Dallas Police Department Open Data Portal.

The Esperanza neighborhood is on the border of two cities, Dallas and Richardson. The neighborhood is a mix of housing and apartment complex residential living. There are five schools within a half mile radius and a very high concentration of families in the area. The area historically has been problematic, Esperanza Rd used to be called Maham Rd (pronounced Mayhem) until a name change came in 2017 as part of the revitalization of the area. Statistically it’s one of the higher crime areas in Dallas, but that’s often overlooked and overshaded due to the area around it being primarily business towers, company campuses and at the corner of two major Dallas freeways. The area recently has had major issues with homelessness and houseless encampments, especially in the Cottonwood Creek/Park area. As a result of the neglect, the area has continued to see spikes in violent crimes and especially violent gun crimes over the past few years.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFencing Before D.I.C.E.

Esperanza is primarily residential, housing several families in close proximity. The build up and overflow of trash in and around residences posed an extreme health safety risk for the residents, particularly the children.

Crown Hill Memorial Park and Bolivar and Larga Rd areas are very high density apartment areas. The neighborhood has a very large immigrant population from a plethora of countries. Most of the residents live near or around Dallas Love Field Airport, which in turn subjects the community at large to an inordinate amount of noise pollution. The focus areas of Bolivar and Larga, and Crown Hill Memorial Park struggle with homelessness, which has become a major issue for both residents and business owners in the area. The area has six schools in a quarter mile radius and is currently a food swamp. The violent crime in the area often goes under and unreported due to the immigrant population being afraid of not only the community repercussions, but the legal ones as well. The area has historically always been working and lower middle class but constant neglect, and divestment from that community have made conditions exponentially worse over the past five to six years.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolivar and Larga Intersection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolivar and Larga Intersection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Strip on the 9600 Block of Webb Chapel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail Strip on the 9600 Block of Webb Chapel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved Signage\n\n    Traffic signage at the Bolivar/Larga intersection is poor and not adequate considering the amount of traffic the area receives.

In the RL Thornton and Jim Miller area there are three motels within a half mile radius that are utilized as extended stays. This area has a set of apartments near, with residential housing being within a quarter mile radius. Historically, the area has always been working and middle class. The area has recently succumbed to a lot of business and retail neglect. Places that were occupied three to five years ago aren’t any longer. Those places not being occupied have harbored opportunities for gun related crimes to occur. Murdock and Loop 12 sits at the corner of a problematic convenience store and the parking lot of a grocery store. The area has three sets of apartment complexes within a quarter mile radius that’s surrounded by residential housing. There are three schools serving this community within a half mile radius. Home to primarily working class people, this area has been historically neglected and severely affected by systematic divestment.\n\n    “I’ve never felt safe over here, I'm just surviving.

The area is chill during the time im here. I've heard about places in the area dealing with robberies but I haven't experienced any of that, thank god. I think the city could put more into this area. I know they plan on making changes at Everglade Park, which is a good start, and hopefully more will follow.” \n    Community Resident\n    \n\n\n\n\nTrash Support\n\n    \"Quam viverra orci sagittis eu volutpat odio.

The build up and overflow of trash poses an extreme health safety risk for the residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce Drive Coordinated by Not My Son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduce Drive Coordinated by Not My Son\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution of Fresh Food\n\n    “It's cool over here, better than a lot of other places I've stayed. Sometimes the homeless people can be annoying but it's not that bad. I wish we had more places to shop other than WalMart, but it could be worse ”\n    Community Resident\n    \nThe area is a food swamp, saturated with low quality, highly processed foods. The area has one grocery store, but no other shopping options for fresh foods. Produce will be brought in and distributed locally for residents.\n\n\n\nUrban Blight Abatement Initiatives\n\n\nCleaning and Greening\n\n\n\n    \"At the inaugural Clean and Green event, we successfully cleaned multiple parking lots and storefronts that were heavily littered, making a significant difference all the way up to the doors. The positive feedback from store managers, owners, and patrons underscores the impact and importance of our efforts in improving the local environment. In addition to the physical cleanup, our Clean and Green event fostered a strong sense of community within the neighborhood. By working together toward a common goal of beautification and environmental stewardship, we strengthened bonds among residents and businesses, creating a more connected and supportive community spirit.\"\n     Tramonica Brown, founder of Not My Son \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover over map markers for address information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\nProduce Drives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n {=html}\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOctober\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nClick to see more\n\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nComing Soon\n\n\n\n\n\nCrime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures based on data provided by the Dallas Police Department in response to our Open Records Request.
